# Assignment: 1955 API
For this assignment, we want you to build a simple API server and communicate with it directly over URL requests. The purpose of this API server is to hold on to a list of people born in the year 1955. In order to allow our API server full functionality over URL, we'll need to make sure all our incoming requests come in as GETs, so don't worry about making your routes RESTful!
